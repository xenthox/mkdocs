# Incentive rewards distribution


Tropos Incentive Testnet will offer SDS resource node providers incentive token rewards TROS(1 TROS = 1,000,000,000 utros) for their effort the same way as the mainnet.<br>
`The total rewards will be 1% of the mainnet token supply, meaning 1,000,000 STOS`.

!!! tip
    Please be advised that you don't need to use your ERC20 STOS to participate in the incentive testnet. 

    Incentive testnet STOS has no value, only the TROS rewards will have value and TROS will be converted to mainnet STOS.

On the incentive testnet, the distribution will be similar but with some adjustments. All the rewards will not be in the form of testnet STOS; rewards token will be named as TROS which will be issued to the wallet of all participants during the period of incentive testnet. Each epoch will distribute 80 TROS as the mining reward.

First, there will be no meta node for public testing. Thus, rewards issued to meta nodes will be changed to a minimum number only for testing purposes.

Second, the staking token for testnet is distributed for free, so it doesn't reflect the contribution to the network in any sense, we cannot distribute the reward based on staking numbers.

The allocation plan for the reward will also be changed accordingly as follows:

``` { .yaml .no-copy }
üèÜ Resource node: 100% of total reward

üèÜ Meta node: 0% of total reward

üèÜ Staking: 0% of total reward
```

At the end of the incentive testnet, we will calculate the total TROS issued and convert it to mainnet STOS based on the ratio of TROS to Total Incentive STOS, which is 1,000,000 tokens. 

For example, during the incentive testnet there is a total of 2,000,000 TROS issued; this will make the TROS: STOS converting rate be 2:1, which means that every 2 TROS will withdraw 1 STOS from the mainnet STOS pool.
