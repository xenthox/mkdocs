# Introduction

The purpose of Tropos Incentive Testnet is to validate all the technical design and network topology that can achieve the goal of our project â€” to provide a fully decentralized high-efficiency storage. On Incentive testnet we will continue all the testing we employed on testnet; in addition, we will try to ensure the network is functional as in the real world, to build an environment as close to the mainnet as possible.

During the Stratos Incentive Network testing period, we will prove the architecture is working as we designed, verify the network's performance can reach the expected level, and confirm the rewarding mechanism is performing as described in the token economy whitepaper.

Our goal for the incentive testnet is to ensure we can migrate to the mainnet smoothly and provide powerful decentralized storage to real corporate world users.
