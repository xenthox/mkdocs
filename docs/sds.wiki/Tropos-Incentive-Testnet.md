# Introduction

The purpose of Tropos Incentive Testnet is to validate all the technical design and network topology that can achieve the goal of our project ‚Äî to provide a fully decentralized high-efficiency storage. On Incentive testnet we will continue all the testing we employed on testnet; in addition, we will try to ensure the network is functional as in the real world, to build an environment as close to the mainnet as possible.

During the Stratos Incentive Network testing period, we will prove the architecture is working as we designed, verify the network‚Äôs performance can reach the expected level, and confirm the rewarding mechanism is performing as described in the token economy whitepaper.

Our goal for the incentive testnet is to ensure we can migrate to the mainnet smoothly and provide powerful decentralized storage to real corporate world users.

    <summary><b>Incentive rewards distribution</b></summary>

<br>

Tropos Incentive Testnet will offer validator providers and SDS resource node providers incentive token rewards TROS(1 TROS = 1,000,000,000 utros) for their effort the same way as the mainnet.
<code>The total rewards will be 1% of the mainnet token supply, meaning 1,000,000 STOS.</code>

On the incentive testnet, the distribution will be similar but with some adjustments. All the rewards will not be in the form of testnet STOS; rewards token will be named as TROS which will be issued to the wallet of all participants during the period of incentive testnet. Each epoch will distribute 80 TROS as the mining reward.

<b>üí° Please be advised that you don't need to use your ERC20 STOS to participate in the incentive testnet. Incentive testnet STOS have no value, only the TROS rewards will have value and TROS will be converted to mainnet STOS</b>.

In our <code>token economy whitepaper</code>, we have described that the mining reward per epoch is 80 STOS that will be distributed as the following:

    üèÜ Resource node: 60% of total reward
    
    üèÜ Meta node: 20% of total reward
    
    üèÜ Staking: 20% of total reward

> For resource nodes, the reward will be issued to <code>the top 80% of traffic contributors at the end of each epoch.</code>
>
> For blockchain, all participants who have staking or delegation will be rewarded in each epoch based on their staking or delegation.
>
> For Meta nodes, the reward will be evenly distributed to all meta nodes.

On the incentive testnet, the distribution will be similar but with some adjustments. All the rewards will not be in the form of testnet STOS; rewards token will be named as TROS which will be issued to the wallet of all participants during the period of incentive testnet. Each epoch will distribute 80 TROS as the mining reward.

First, there will be no meta node for public testing. Thus, rewards issued to meta nodes will be changed to a minimum number only for testing purposes.

Second, the staking token for testnet is distributed for free, so it doesn‚Äôt reflect the contribution to the network in any sense, we cannot distribute the reward based on staking numbers.

The allocation plan for the reward will also be changed accordingly as follows:

    üèÜ Resource node: 100% of total reward
    
    üèÜ Meta node: 0% of total reward
    
    üèÜ Staking: 0% of total reward

At the end of the incentive testnet, we will calculate the total TROS issued and convert it to mainnet STOS based on the ratio of TROS to Total Incentive STOS, which is 1,000,000 tokens. For example, during the incentive testnet there is a total of 2,000,000 TROS issued; this will make the TROS: STOS converting rate be 2:1, which means that every 2 TROS will withdraw 1 STOS from the mainnet STOS pool.

    <summary><b>Highlight Changes in `tropos-5`</b></summary><blockquote>
  
<br>

After testing and building the binaries v0.9.0, we release the latest version of Stratos-Testnet, with a new chain-id `tropos-5`.

This version covers several breakthrough improvements and significant performance enhancements.
we will highlight the major exciting updates in this section. 

<br>

<details>
    <summary><b>New Changes</b></summary>


- EVM Module

  The integration of EVM module makes Stratos chain compatible with both Ethereum and Cosmos-based ecosystems,
  facilitating Stratos to apply a variety of DApps and introduce more features.

###

- Accounts

  To compatible with various existing Ethereum DApps, the `address` and `type`(from `secp256k1` to `ethsecp256k1`)
  for account have been changed.

  For example, when checking an account, you will find the differences in `address` and `pub_key`.
  
  Before:
  
  ```
  ./stchaind query account st1am40hqkacscgwvvsjcxzxk49r8cuamgyrcgppg
  |
  '@type': /cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount
  account_number: "4"
  address: st1am40hqkacscgwvvsjcxzxk49r8cuamgyrcgppg
  pub_key:
    "@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey"
    key: AmPEqFHLzLPORjHpTCG/Q6SPYnRae7ehf7cKuzvfRs8v
  sequence: "3"
  ```
  
  
  `tropos-5`:
  
  ```
  ./stchaind query account st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4
  |
  '@type': /cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount
  account_number: "5"
  address: st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4
  pub_key:
    '@type': /stratos.crypto.v1.ethsecp256k1.PubKey
    key: AmPEqFHLzLPORjHpTCG/Q6SPYnRae7ehf7cKuzvfRs8v
  sequence: "1"
  ```
  
  From `tropos-5` on, all the accounts will be identified by `ethsecp256k1`, while the `secp256k1` will be unavailable.

###

- Token Denom and Decimal

  Most Existing Ethereum DApps have 18 decimals, e.g., 1 ETH is represented by 10e18 of its natural unit
  ( 1Ether = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000wei ). Similarly, most ERC-20 tokens simply follow this standard.
  
  In order to get much greater precision and be consistent with this rule, the previous token denom `ustos`
  (9 decimals) is NOT in use anymore. Instead, a serial of new denominations `stos`(18 decimals), `gwei`(9 decimals)
  and `wei` have been brought into effect. That is,
  
  ```
  1stos = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000wei
  1stos = 1,000,000,000gwei
  1gwei = 1,000,000,000wei
  ```
  
  For simplicity, token amount can be easily represented as `value`+`denom`. In practice, you can enter
  `1stos`, or `1000000000gwei`, or `1000000000000000000wei` to indicate the same amount of tokens.
  
  In `tropos-5`, we keep the same reward issued to Resource Node previously. `utros`(9 decimals) is still the
  only valid denom for incentive reward as before. i.e.,
  
  ```
  1tros = 1,000,000,000utros
  ```
  
###

- Software Upgrade

  To avoid two critical vulnerabilities in the Cosmos-SDK ( [Dragonberry](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-dragonberry/7702)
  and [Elderflower](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-sdk-security-advisory-elderflower/8584), discovered in October 2022),
  we have upgraded Cosmos-SDK to v0.45.9.
  
  Correspondingly, if you prefer to build and compile the binary from source code,
  you need to have [`Go 1.18+`](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed, rather than the former `Go 1.16+`.


###

- SDS Resource Node Maintenance

  Resource Node participates in Stratos Decentralized Storage(SDS) activities and thus earns rewards by providing its
  disk/bandwidth/computation power. It is expected to maintain regular hardware/software updates to prevent from
  unexpected misbehaves like node crashing, loosing connectivity or getting attacks.
  
  In `tropos-5`, `maintenance` functionality has been implemented for users to claim when a maintenance is required, without any worry
  being slashed.
  
    * `maintenance start <duration>` command starts a maintenance activity and switches the node into `maintenance` mode
    for the requested duration (in seconds);
    * While a Resource Node is in `maintenance` mode, it will be opt-out from any download/upload/backup tasks;
    * While a Resource Node is in `maintenance` mode, it will NOT be slashed for its off-line;
    * The maintenance allowance is maxed out after reach 1% up-time per year(around 87h). Then, any maintenance request
      will be rejected;
    * The maintenance allowance will be tracked and be reset every calendar year for all nodes;
    * When using the `maintenance stop` to stop the current maintenance, or the maintenance period is over,
      the node status reverts to `offline` and is ready to restart mining. It acts as usual to earn rewards or be slashed.
  
###

- Restriction of Transaction Fees

  Before `tropos-5`, transaction fees are not strictly required. To reflect scenarios on mainnet, in `tropos-5`,
  transaction fees become a required parameter(s) in each transaction command.
  
  Transaction fees in `tropos-5` follows cosmos-SDK gas calculating rule `fees = gas * gas-prices`. As a result, there are
  two options to add up transaction fees to a command,
  
  * use `--fees=<fees amount>`. e.g., `--fees=10000gwei`.
  
  Or
  * use `--gas=<gas amount>/auto --gas-prices=<gas price>`. e.g., `--gas=100000 --gas-prices=0.1gwei`
  
  Or
  `--gas=auto --gas-prices=0.01gwei`(to use the estimated amount of gas)
  
  In `tropos-5`, a `minimum-gas-prices` is defined by default in `config/app.toml` under the node folder:
  
  ```
  minimum-gas-prices = "1000000000wei"
  ```
  
  Indeed, users can determine their own customized value of `gas-prices` when starting a full node, like
  ```
  ./stchaind start --minimum-gas-prices=0.1gwei
  ```
  
  Note: the value of `minimum-gas-prices` should be always greater than `10,000,000wei`(`0.01gwei`).  When the given 
  `--minimum-gas-prices` is less than this threshold, `10,000,000wei` will be taken instead.

    <summary><b>Migrate Mature Reward to `tropos-5`</b></summary>

####

* For newcomers, just skip this section and follow the instructions in the rest of this guide to set up `tropos-5`.

####

* For existing users, the incentive reward issued previously will be kept with the same private/public key combination.
  However, as mentioned above, the account address will be changed in `tropos-5`.

  The balance in the new `ethsecp256k1` account address will keep the same as that in the old `secp256k1` account address.
  If it is impossible to retrieve the old secp256k1 account public key, resulting in the new `ethsecp256k1` account
  cannot be generated based on the old one, the balance will be transferred to the `mature reward` of the old `secp256k1` account.
  In this case, you need to migrate the reward to your new `ethsecp256k1` account.

  Do not worry about the balance. The only thing you need to do is to check your incentive reward of the old `secp256k1` account
  and withdraw it to the new `ethsecp256k1` account.

  Let's break down this task step by step with an example.
  
  ####
  Suppose you have an existing `secp256k1` account. It was created as
  ```
  name: cosmosUser0
  address: st1am40hqkacscgwvvsjcxzxk49r8cuamgyrcgppg
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AmPEqFHLzLPORjHpTCG/Q6SPYnRae7ehf7cKuzvfRs8v"}'
  mnemonic: "ocean jar useless fame slice history retreat banana life wing lesson work amount adult tray zone
  payment window since dash immune grunt army deer"
  ```
  
  ####

  - Backup the previous `secp256k1` account files

    By default, under the node folder `$HOME/.stchaind`, there is `keyring-test` folder which holds the accounts' info.
    It looks like
      ```
      .
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ b37acf3e6daa547c8034d27893720a9fcf3eea44.address
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cosmosUser0.info
      ```
    Copy this `keyring-test` folder to a secure place.

  ####

  - Download the binary and config files for `tropos-5`. Follow the instructions in the next sections

    until the `Setup a wallet and faucet` step. Next, you need to create an `ethsecp256k1` account based on
    your old `secp256k1` account.

  ####

  - Create(Recover) a new corresponding `ethsecp256k1` account 
    - Using the same mnemonic(recommended)
    
      1. Remove all the files in `keyring-test` folder 
      2. Recover your account with the same mnemonic, i.e.,

     ```
      ./stchaind keys add ethUser0 --recover --chain-id=tropos-5 --keyring-backend=test --hd-path="m/44'/606'/0'/0/0"
       > Enter your bip39 mnemonic
       ocean jar useless fame slice history retreat banana life wing lesson work amount adult tray zone payment window since dash immune grunt army deer

      - name: ethUser0
       address: st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4
       pubkey: '{"@type":"/stratos.crypto.v1.ethsecp256k1.PubKey","key":"AmPEqFHLzLPORjHpTCG/Q6SPYnRae7ehf7cKuzvfRs8v"}'
       mnemonic: ""
     ```
   
    - Using `stchaind keys` commands
    
      This method uses `stchaind keys` commands to convert your old `secp256k1` account into a 
      new `ethsecp256k1` account in case you don't have the mnemonic words saved. It is an unsafe method  because 
      your private/public key is explicitly print out in the terminal. Please do this on your own hardware machine instead of cloud server. 
      
      1. Keep all the files in `keyring-test` folder
      2. Export `cosmosUser0`
    
      ```
        ./stchaind keys export cosmosUser0 --keyring-backend=test --unsafe --unarmored-hex
      
        WARNING: The private key will be exported as an unarmored hexadecimal string. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Continue? [y/N]: y
        18132eae6f96851959d2787aab9f018d9cfe977c619ee951490c6a1c692f2783          ## exported-key-hex
      ```
      3. Delete the old `cosmosUser0` account
      
      ```
         ./stchaind keys delete cosmosUser0 --keyring-backend=test 
      ```

      4. Unsafe-import-eth-key `ethUser0`
      
       ```
         ./stchaind keys unsafe-import-eth-key ethUser0 18132eae6f96851959d2787aab9f018d9cfe977c619ee951490c6a1c692f2783 --keyring-backend=test
      
         Enter passphrase to encrypt your key:   ## if you are using `--keyring-backend=test` in your command, use `12345678` as the passphrase
       ```
       üí° You should use default passphrase `12345678` if you are using `--keyring-backend=test`. 
          You can use your own if you are not using the `test` keyring-backend.
    
       5. Confirm account conversion

       ```
         ./stchaind keys list --keyring-backend=test
      
         - name: ethUser0
           type: local
           address: st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4
           pubkey: '{"@type":"/stratos.crypto.v1.ethsecp256k1.PubKey","key":"AmPEqFHLzLPORjHpTCG/Q6SPYnRae7ehf7cKuzvfRs8v"}'
           mnemonic: ""                                       
       ```
  
  ####

  - Acquire `stos` tokens to activate the newly created `ethUser0` account

    For example, you can `faucet` your account (please replace the value of `address` with your real account address)
      ```
       curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"denom":"stos","address":"st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4"}' https://faucet-tropos.thestratos.org/credit
      ```

  ####

  - Start the chain and wait for full synchronization
      ```
       ./stchaind start
      ```

  ####

  - Check the balance in the new `ethsecp256k1` account
    ```
      ./stchaind query bank balances <your new `ethsecp256k1` account address>
    ```
    The response to this command determines if your account has been migrated automatically. For example,

    1. With a balance of `utros`
    
      ```
      ./stchaind query bank balances st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4
      balances:
      - amount: "233606"
        denom: utros
      - amount: "10000000000000000000"
        denom: wei
        pagination:
        next_key: null
        total: "0"
     ``` 
     ```http request
      üí° In the above example, the balance includes `233606 utros`. It indicates your account has been migrated automatically. 
         Please skip the following steps, and you can operate the same as before.
     ```

    2. Without a balance of `utros`
    
      ```
      ./stchaind query bank balances st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4
      balances:
      - amount: "10000000000000000000"
        denom: wei
      pagination:
      next_key: null
      total: "0"
     ``` 
    The response does not include a `utros` balance, while you actually had it in the old `secp256k1` account. 
    In another word, if you find your `utros` balance is missing, please follow the next steps to migrate the incentive 
    reward to the new `ethsecp256k1` account manually.

    ####

  - Check the rewards in the old `secp256k1` account
      ```
       https://rest-tropos.thestratos.org/pot/rewards/wallet/st1am40hqkacscgwvvsjcxzxk49r8cuamgyrcgppg
      ```
    Response Example:
      ```json
      {
          "height": "1826",
          "result": {
              "wallet_address": "st1am40hqkacscgwvvsjcxzxk49r8cuamgyrcgppg",
              "MatureTotalReward": [
                  {
                      "denom": "utros",
                      "amount": "1696408013053"
                  },
                  {
                      "denom": "wei",
                      "amount": "3576778"
                  }
              ],
              "ImmatureTotalReward": [
                  {
                      "denom": "utros",
                      "amount": "872451398"
                  },
                  {
                      "denom": "wei",
                      "amount": "278865"
                  }
              ]
          }
      }
     ```
    The above response shows that there are `1696408013053utros` of mature reward held in your old `secp256k1`
    account. Next we will withdraw `100ustros` to the new `ethUser0` account for instance.

    ####

  - Withdraw mature reward from `secp256k1` account to the new corresponding `ethsecp256k1`
    account using `legacy-withdraw` command
      ```
        ./stchaind tx pot legacy-withdraw --target-address=st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4 --from=st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4 --amount=100utros --chain-id=tropos-5 --keyring-backend=test --gas=1000000 --gas-prices=1000000000wei -y
      ```

    ####

  - Check the balance in the new `ethsecp256k1` account again
     ```
       ./stchaind query bank balances st1d3qtsjyypa639q9kf0wmuf2dn4a7zrnujw84q4
        balances:
         - amount: "100"
           denom: utros
         - amount: "9999000000000000000"
           denom: wei
       pagination:
       next_key: null
       total: "0"
     ```
    An amount of `100ustros` mature reward has been transferred to the new account.

  ####

  - Check the balance in the old `secp256k1` account again
     ```
       https://rest-tropos.thestratos.org/pot/rewards/wallet/st1am40hqkacscgwvvsjcxzxk49r8cuamgyrcgppg
      ```
    Response Example:
     ```json
      {
          "height": "1937",
          "result": {
              "wallet_address": "st1am40hqkacscgwvvsjcxzxk49r8cuamgyrcgppg",
              "MatureTotalReward": [
                  {
                      "denom": "utros",
                      "amount": "1696408012953"
                  },
                  {
                      "denom": "wei",
                      "amount": "3576778"
                  }
              ],
              "ImmatureTotalReward": [
                  {
                      "denom": "utros",
                      "amount": "872451398"
                  },
                  {
                      "denom": "wei",
                      "amount": "278865"
                  }
              ]
          }
      }
     ```
    Correspondingly, an amount of `100ustros` mature reward has been withdrawn from the old account.

    Similarly, you can withdraw all the mature rewards to the new `ethsecp256k1` account using
    `legacy-withdraw` command. Note that only mature reward can be withdrawn immediately.

    You have migrated your TROS reward to tropos-5 successfully.

Stratos blockchain facilitates all decentralized ledger transactions and functionalities, providing settlement services and related financial payment services for network providers and network users in an efficient, fair and transparent manner.

The Stratos-chain full-nodes are dedicated servers with sufficient computing power that participate in block generation cycle. It is necessary in order to be a validator.

In practice, running a full-node only implies running a non-compromised and up-to-date version of the software with low network latency and without downtime. It is encouraged to run a full-node even if you do not plan to be a validator.

The Stratos-chain validator is a full-node that participates in the Stratos Chain block generation cycle and also voting for the validity of a block proposed.

    <summary><b>Requirements</b></summary>

<br>
Here are the recommended hardware/software to run a Stratos-chain full-node

###

- <b>Recommended Hardware</b>

        * CPU           i5 (4 cores)
        * RAM           16GB
        * Hard disk     2TB

###

- <b>Software(tested version)</b>

        * Ubuntu 18.04+
        * Go 1.18+ linux/amd64

#

    <summary><b>Setup Environment</b></summary>

<br>

In order to run a Stratos-chain full-node, you may need to build `stratos-chain` source code yourself which requires `Go 1.18+`, `git`, `curl` and `make` installed.

This process depends on your operating system.

- <b>Linux Users</b>

  #### 

  The following example is based on Ubuntu 18.04+ 64-bit(Debian) and assumes you are using a terminal environment by default.
  Please run the equivalent commands if you are running other Linux distributions.

    ```shell
    # Update the system
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
        
    # Install git, snap and make(you can also install them separately as your needs)
    sudo apt install git build-essential curl snapd --yes
        
    # Install Go 1.18+ with Snap and export environment variables(You can also install Go 1.18+ in your way)
    sudo snap install go --classic
    echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export GOBIN="$GOPATH/bin"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export PATH="$GOBIN:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
    ```

<br>


- <b>MacOS Users</b>

  ####

  To install the required build tools, you can easily [install Xcode from the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en&mt=12)

  The best practice to install Go is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

    ```shell
    # Install software using Homebrew
    brew install go git curl
    
    # Export environment variables
    echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export GOBIN="$GOPATH/bin"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export PATH="$GOBIN:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
    ```

<br>

- <b>Windows Users</b>

  ####

  It is possible to build and run the software on Windows. However, we did not test it on Windows completely.
  It may give you unexpected results, or it may require additional setup.

  An alternative option is to install a separate virtual Linux system using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)

    <summary><b>Setup a Stratos-chain full-node</b></summary>

<br>

- <b>Create a user account <code>stratos</code>(optional)</b>

  ####

  To create a separated and more secure environment, it is recommended to create a separated user account `stratos` to run your node.

    ```shell
    sudo adduser stratos --home /home/stratos
    ```

  Once the user account `stratos` is created, switch and login the system using `stratos`. You will proceed with the following steps in context of that user.

<br>


- <b>Get release binary executable files</b>

  ####

  There are two ways to get the these binary executables. Please choose either of them based on your working system.
  ###

    - <b>Ubuntu 18.04+</b>

      ####

        - <b>Download binary executables</b>

          ####

          The following binary `stchaind` has been built and ready to be downloaded directly.

          ```shell
            # Make sure we are inside the $HOME folder
            cd $HOME
            wget https://github.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain/releases/download/v0.9.0/stchaind
           ```

          > üí° This binary is built for Ubuntu 18.04+ amd64. if you have other Linux kernels, please follow Step 1.2 to build your own binary with source code.
          >
          > For ease of use, we recommend saving this binary in your `$HOME` folder. If you are not sure what is your `$HOME` folder, in terminal, use `echo $HOME` to check. In the following instruction, we assume you have entered the `$HOME` folder(use `cd $HOME`)

            - <b>Check the granularity</b>

              #### 

              ```shell
              # Make sure we are inside the $HOME folder and check these two binary executables
              cd $HOME

              # Check granularity
              md5sum stchain*

              ## Expected output
              ## 1843b162a7d2b1f4363938fc73d421e8  stchaind
              ```

            - <b>Add execute permission to this binary </b>

              ####

              ```shell
              # Make sure the file can be executed
              chmod +x stchaind
              ```
            - <b>Add the binary to the search path</b>

              ####

              ```shell
              echo 'export PATH="$HOME:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
              source ~/.profile
              ```
            <br>

    - <b>Compile the binary executables with source code</b>

      ####

      Before the following steps, please make sure you have `Go 1.18+` installed [link](https://golang.org/doc/install).

        - <b>Build the extracted source code</b>

          ```shell
          git clone https://github.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain.git
          cd stratos-chain
          git checkout tags/v0.9.0
          make build
          ```
          <br>

        - <b>Installing the binary executable</b>

          The binary can be installed to the default $GOPATH/bin folder by running:

          ```shell
          make install
          ```
        <br>

- <b>Get the genesis and configuration files</b>

  ####

    - <b>Initialize your node</b>

      ####

        ```bash
        # Make sure we are inside the home directory
        cd $HOME
      
        # Create folders and initialize the node
        ./stchaind init "<your_node_moniker>"
      
        # ignore the output since you need to download the genesis file 
        ```

      > üí° You can choose any `your_node_moniker` you prefer. It will be saved in the `config.toml` under the `.stchaind/config/` directory.

- <b>Download the `genesis.json` and `config.toml` files</b>

  ####        

  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain-testnet/main/genesis.json
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain-testnet/main/config.toml
  ```

    > üí° We strongly recommend using this downloaded `config.toml` for v0.9.0, instead of the ones for previous versions to avoid any mismatching. A sample of `config.toml` can be found below

    <summary><b>Run your Stratos-chain full-node</b></summary>

<br>

There are three ways to run your Stratos-chain full-node. Please choose ONE of them to start the node.

- <b>`stchaind start` command</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    # Make sure we are inside the home directory
    cd $HOME
    
    # run your node
    ./stchaind start
    
    # Use `Ctrl+c` to stop the node.
    ```

- <b>Run node in background</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    # Make sure we are inside the home directory
    cd $HOME
    
    # run your node in backend
    ./stchaind start 2>&1 >> chain.log & 
    ```
  Use an editor to check your node log at `chain.log`

  Use the following Linux Command to stop your node.
    ```shell
    pkill stchaind
    ```

- <b>Run node as a service</b>

  ####

  All below steps require root privileges

  ####

    - <b>Create the service file</b>

      ####

      Create the `/lib/systemd/system/stratos.service` file with the following content

      ```shell
      [Unit]
      Description=Stratos Chain Node
      After=network-online.target
  
      [Service]
      User=stratos
      ExecStart=/home/stratos/stchaind start --home=/home/stratos/.stchaind
      Restart=on-failure
      RestartSec=3
      LimitNOFILE=8192
  
      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```

      > üí° In the [service] section
      > - `User` is your system login username
      > - `ExecStart` designates the absolute path to the binary `stchaind`
      > - `--home` is the absolute path to your node folder.
      > - We used the default values for these variables. If you use a different username, group or folder to hold your node data instead of the default values, please modify these values according to your situations. Make sure the above values are correct.

    - <b>Start your service</b>

      ####

      Once you have successfully created the service, you need to enable and start it by running

      ```shell
      systemctl daemon-reload
      systemctl enable stratos.service
      systemctl start stratos.service
      ```
  ###

    - <b>Service operations</b>

      ###

        - <b>Check the service status</b>

          ####

          ```shell
          systemctl status stratos.service
          ```
        - <b>Check service log</b>

          ####

          ```shell
          journalctl -u stratos.service -f 
      
          # exit with ctrl+c
          ```

        - <b>Stop the service</b>

          ####

          ```shell
          systemctl stop stratos.service

Once you start your full-node, it will connect to the peers and start syncing. You can check the status of the node by running the following command

```shell
# Check the status of the node
./stchaind status
```

The output will be similar to

```shell

<details>
    <summary><b>Setup a wallet and faucet</b></summary>

<br>

Once the node finishes catch-up, you are ready to operate your node for various transactions(tx) and queries.

> üí° By default, the following commands can be applied in the node folder(`$HOME`) directory.


- <b>Create a wallet account</b>

  ####

  In order to hold the tokens that you will later delegate to your validator node, or pay staking for your SDS resource node, first, you need to create a local wallet account.

  ###

    - <b>Create a new wallet account</b>

      ####

      To create a new wallet account, type the following command

      ```shell
      ./stchaind keys add <your wallet name> --hd-path="m/44'/606'/0'/0/0" --keyring-backend=<keyring's backend>
      ```

      > üí° In the testing phase, the `keyring's backend` is `test`, i.e., `--keyring-backend=test`
      >
      > Please select a wallet name that you will easily remember. This name will be used all over the places inside other commands later.

      After creating a new local wallet account, you will get its `address` and `pubkey`.

      In addition, you will have a secret recovery phrase(mnemonic phrase) which can be used to recover an existing wallet account and should be kept secret.

      ###

      <details>
          <summary><b>Example</b></summary>

      ```shell
      ./stchaind keys add myWallet --hd-path="m/44'/606'/0'/0/0" --keyring-backend=test

      - name: myWallet
        type: local

    <summary><b>Setup and Run SDS Resource Node</b></summary><blockquote>

<br>

The Stratos Decentralized Storage (SDS) network is a scalable, reliable, self-balancing elastic acceleration network. We can simply take it as a decentralized file system suitable for running on general-purpose hardware.

SDS is composed of many Resource Nodes that store data, and a few Meta Nodes that coordinate with each other.

Note that provides their resource(disk/bandwidth/computation power) for SDS is called Resource Node.

###

<details>
    <summary><b>Requirements</b></summary>

<br>

Unlike other projects, Stratos does not require expensive GPUs and high wattage power supplies, but the node needs to provide enough bandwidth and storage capacity to ensure the traffic on the node can reach the reward requirements.

####

- <b>Recommended Hardware</b>

    * CPU           i5 (4 cores)
    * RAM           16GB
    * Hard disk     2TB
    * Bandwidth     100M

####

- <b>Software(tested version)</b>

    * Ubuntu 18.04+
    * Go 1.18+ linux/amd64

###

</details>


<details>
    <summary><b>Keywords</b></summary>
<br>

There are some keywords that are widely used in SDS. We describe them as

* `resource node`(`PP` node): Node that participates in the Stratos Resource Network by providing their disk/bandwidth/computation power to earn rewards in the Proof-of-Traffic(PoT) model.

* `meta node`(`SP` nodes): Node that manages the tasks in the Resource Network between resource nodes, including indexing all content, auditing the traffic report and communicating between Resource Network and Stratos-chain through a relay mechanism.

* `active resource node`: A resource node that has been activated by depositing to the Stratos-chain and registering to a meta node. It is ready to receive tasks assigned by the meta node.

* `suspended resource node`: A resource node that has not satisfied the performance KPI evaluation criteria and is suspended from receiving further tasks from the meta node.

* `traffic`: The data volume evaluated in the Resource Network. The incentive for all participants in the Stratos Ecosystem is based on traffic.

* `STOS`(Stratos Tokens): The native token facilitating value circulation in Stratos Ecosystem.

* `ozone`(oz): The traffic unit used in Stratos Ecosystem.

* `epoch`: The Proof-of-Traffic evaluation periodic window. The traffic for the Resource Network is evaluated at the end of each epoch.

* `value network`: The Stratos-chain, the network that circulates all values in the Stratos Ecosystem.

    <summary><b>Setup Environment</b></summary>

<br>

In order to run an SDS resource node, you need to build SDS source code which requires `Go 1.18+`, `git`, `curl` and `make` installed.
If you have installed them previously, just skip this section. Otherwise, please install them as the following

This process depends on your operating system.

- <b>Linux Users</b>

  #### 

  The following example is based on Ubuntu 18.04+ 64-bit(Debian) and assumes you are using a terminal environment by default.
  Please run the equivalent commands if you are running other Linux distributions.

    ```shell
    # Update the system
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
        
    # Install git, snap and make(you can also install them separately as your needs)
    sudo apt install git build-essential curl snapd --yes
        
    # Install Go 1.18+ with Snap and export environment variables(You can also install Go 1.18+ in your way)
    sudo snap install go --classic
    echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export GOBIN="$GOPATH/bin"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export PATH="$GOBIN:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
    ```

<br>


- <b>MacOS Users</b>

  ####

  To install the required build tools, you can easily [install Xcode from the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en&mt=12)

  The best practice to install Go is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

    ```shell
    # Install software using Homebrew
    brew install go git curl
    
    # Export environment variables
    echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export GOBIN="$GOPATH/bin"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export PATH="$GOBIN:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
    ```

<br>

- <b>Windows Users</b>

  ####

  It is possible to build and run the software on Windows. However, we did not test it on Windows completely.
  It may give you unexpected results, or it may require additional setup.

  An alternative option is to install a separate virtual Linux system using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)

    <summary><b>Setup SDS resource node</b></summary>

<br>

- <b>Compile the binary executables with source code</b>

  ####

  Before the following steps, please make sure you have `Go 1.18+` installed ([link](https://golang.org/doc/install)).

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/stratosnet/sds.git
    cd sds
    git checkout tags/v0.9.0
    make build
    ```
  Then you will find the binary executable `ppd` under the folder `target`

  ###

- <b>Installing the binary executable</b>

  ####

  The binary can be installed to the default `$GOPATH/bin` folder by running:

  ```shell
  make install
  ```
  The binary should then be runnable from any folder if you have set up `go env` properly.

    <summary><b>Create SDS resource node</b></summary>

###

- <b>Creating a root directory</b>

  ####

  To start a resource node, you need to be in a directory dedicated to your resource node.
  Create a new directory, or go to the root directory of your existing node.
  In the following instruction, we assume you have entered the root directory of the resource node.

    ```shell
    # create a new folder 
    cd $HOME
    mkdir rsnode
    # Make sure we are inside the root directory of the resource node
    cd rsnode
    ```

  ###

    - <b>Configuring SDS resource node</b>

      ####

      Next, you need to generate the configuration file and its accounts of this resource node. The command `ppd config` will help you to generate necessary configurations.
      ####

        - <b>Generate/Recover local wallet</b>
          ###

          The `ppd config` command consists of several flags or subcommand. Let take a look at its general definition using `ppd config -h`.

          ```shell
          ppd config -h
        
          create default configuration file
      
          Usage:
            ppd config [flags]
            ppd config [command]
      
          Available Commands:
            accounts    create accounts for the node
      
          Flags:
            -p, --create-p2p-key   create p2p key with config file, need interactive input
            -w, --create-wallet    create wallet with config file, need interactive input
            -h, --help             help for config
      
          Global Flags:
            -c, --config string   configuration file path  (default "./configs/config.toml")
            -r, --home string     path for the node (default "<root directory of your resource node>")
  
          Use "ppd config [command] --help" for more information about a command.
          ```

          If you already have an existing wallet account, you can use the same one here by entering its mnemonic phrase.
          Otherwise, you can generate a new wallet account.

          There are two ways to get the configuration file and its accounts of this resource node.

          ###

            - Option 1: Using <b><code>ppd config -w -p</code></b> command
              >   üí° This command provides an interactive way to communicate with SDS and makes it possible to create the same wallet account for multiple resource nodes.
              >
              >   When asking `input bip39 mnemonic`,
              >
              >>   Input your mnemonic -> recovering an existing wallet account;
              >>
              >>   keep it blank -> generating a new wallet account

              Please refer to the following examples

              ```shell
              # Make sure we are inside the root directory of the resource node
              cd rsnode
        
              # to create config with interactive key creation
              ppd config -w -p
              ```

            - <b>Change the value of `chain_id`</b>

              ####

              The value of `chain_id` is visible on [`Stratos Explorer`](https://explorer-tropos.thestratos.org/) right next to the search bar at the top of the page.
              Currently, for the Tropos Incentive Testnet, set `chain_id` as:

              ```shell
               chain_id = 'tropos-5'
              ```
              <br>

            - <b>Set the value of `network_address`</b>

              ####

              Finally, make sure to set the `network_address` to your public IP address and port.
              If your resource node is behind a router, you probably need to configure port forwarding on the router, like

                ```toml
                # if your node is behind a router, you probably need to configure port forwarding on the router
                port = '18081'
                network_address = 'your node external ip' 
                ```
              > üí° It is not the meta node network_address in `[[sp_list]]` section

              ##

<details> 
    <summary><b>Run SDS resource node</b></summary>

<br>

- <b>Acquiring test STOS tokens(`faucet`)</b>

  ####

  Before manipulating your resource node, you need to acquire some STOS tokens.
  You can get test tokens through the faucet API

  ```shell
  curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"denom":"stos","address":"your wallet address"} ' https://faucet-tropos.thestratos.org/credit
  ```

    <br>

- <b>Starting SDS resource node</b>

  ####

  After set up configuration properly, filled your wallet with some tokens, you can now start your resource node.

    - <b>Start resource node</b>

      ####

      It will start the resource node as a daemon in background without interactivity.

      ```shell
      # Make sure we are inside the root directory of the resource node
      cd rsnode
      # start the resource node
      ppd start
      ```
  ##

  </details>


<details>
    <summary><b>Interact with SDS resource node</b></summary>

###

- <b>Interactive operation via `ppd terminal`</b>

  ####

  In order to interact with the resource node, you need to open A NEW COMMAND-LINE TERMINAL, and enter the root directory of the same resource node.
  Then, use `ppd terminal` commands to start the interaction with resource node.

  ```shell
  # Open a new command-line terminal
  # Make sure we are inside the root directory of the same resource node
  cd rsnode
  # Interact with resource node through a set of "ppd terminal" subcommands
  ppd terminal
  ```

  > `ppd terminal` needs to be executed in A NEW COMMAND-LINE TERMINAL(called as `ppd terminal` terminal).
  >
  > All `ppd terminal` [subcommands](https://github.com/stratosnet/sds/wiki/%60ppd-terminal%60--subcommands) should be executed in this `ppd terminal` terminal.

  Hereafter, we will use a set of `ppd terminal` [subcommands](https://github.com/stratosnet/sds/wiki/%60ppd-terminal%60--subcommands) 
  to communicate with the resource node in `ppd terminal`.

  ####

- <b>Registering the resource node to a meta node</b>
  The resource node(PP) should be registered to a meta node(SP) before doing anything else.
  In `ppd terminal`, input one of the two following identical subcommands

    ```shell
    rp
    
    #or
    registerpeer
    ```
  ####

  
- <b>Uploading/Downloading files without staking</b>

  ####

  You do not need to stake anything if you just want to upload/download files. 
  After registering your resource node(`rp` subcommand), purchase enough `ozone` using the `prepay` subcommand. 
  Then, use `put` or `get` subcommands to upload/download files.

    ```shell
    prepay <amount> <fee> [gas]     # prepay 1stos 6000000gwei 6000000 
    ```
  
    ```shell
    put <filepath>     # put config.toml 
    
    get <sdm://account/filehash> [saveAs]  # get sdm://st172v4u8ysfgaphjs8uyy0svvc6d6tzl6gp07kn4/v05ahm51l6v6tm2vqc682b9sicom61fgkoqdl0pg
    ```
  This is a quick way for users to upload/download their files. Resource node can go offline at any time without being punished.
  On the other hand, since the resource node is not activated, users will not receive mining rewards(`utros`).

###

- <b>Activating the resource node with staking</b>

  ####

  You can activate your resource node by staking an amount of tokens. After it is activated successfully,
  your resource node starts to receive tasks from meta nodes and thus gaining mining rewards automatically.

    ```shell
    activate <amount> <fee> [gas] 
    ```
  > `amount` is the amount of tokens you want to stake. 1stos = 10^9gwei = 10^18wei.
  >
  > `fee` is the amount of tokens to pay as a fee for the activation transaction. 10000wei would work. it will use default value if not provide.
  >
  > `gas` is the amount of gas to pay for the transaction. 1000000 would be a safe number. it will use default value if not provide.

  Example:
    ```shell
    >activate 2stos 0.01stos 1000000
    ```

<details>
    <summary><b>Use other <code>ppd terminal</code> subcommands to operate resource node</b></summary>

####

Here we introduce a set of these `ppd terminal` subcommands in brief that you can try in the `ppd terminal` terminal.
Please refer to [ppd terminal subcommands](https://github.com/stratosnet/sds/wiki/%60ppd-terminal%60--subcommands) for more details.

###

- <b>Check the current status of a resource node</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    status
    ```
###

- <b>Update stake of an active resource node</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    updateStake <stakeDelta> <fee> [gas] <isIncrStake>  
    ```
  > `stakeDelta` is the absolute amount of difference between the original and the updated stake. It should be a positive valid
  token, in the unit of `stos`/`gwei`/`wei`.
  >
  > `isIncrStake` is a boolean flag with `false` for decreasing the original stake and `true` for increasing the original stake.
  >
  > When a resource node is suspended, use this command to update its state and re-start mining by increasing its stake.

  Example:
    ```shell
    updateStake 1stos 1000000gwei 1000000 true
    ```
  The above command will increase 1stos to stake, use 1000000gwei for tx fee and 1000000 for tx gas.

###

- <b>Purchase `ozone`</b>

  ####

  Ozone is the unit of traffic used by SDS. Operations involving network traffic require `ozone` to be executed.
  You can purchase ozone with the following command

    ```shell
    prepay <amount> <fee> [gas]
    ```
  > `amount` is the amount of tokens you want to spend to purchase ozone.

###


- <b>Query ozone balance of a node's wallet</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    getoz <walletAddress>
    ```
###

- <b>Create a new wallet, input password after prompt</b>
  ###

    ```shell
    newwallet <walletName> 
    ```

###

- <b>Upload a file</b>

  ###

    ```shell
    put <filepath>
    ```
  > `filepath` is the location of the file to upload, starting from your resource node folder. It is better to be an absolute path.
###

- <b>Upload a media file for streaming</b>

  ###

  Streaming is the continuous transmission of audio or video files(media files) from a server to a client.
  In order to upload a streaming file, first you need to install a tool `ffmpeg` for transcoding multimedia files.

  In Linux Terminal:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    
    # use ffmpeg -version to check its version
    ffmpeg -version
    ```
  In MacOS Terminal:

    ```shell
    brew update
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

  ###
  Then, back to the `ppd terminal` terminal, use `putstream` command to upload a media file

    ```shell
    putstream <filepath>
    ```

  > `filepath` is the absolute path of the file to be uploaded, or a relative path starting from the root directory of the resource node.

###

- <b>List all uploaded files</b>

  `list` or `ls`

  ####

    ```shell
    ls
    ```
###


- <b>Download an uploaded file</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    get <sdm://account/filehash> [saveAs]
    ```
  > üí° Every file uploaded to SDS is attributed with a unique file hash.
  >
  > You can view the file hash for each of your files when you `list` your uploaded files.
  >
  > Use the optional parameter `saveAs` to rename the file
  > 
  > The downloaded file will be saved into `download` folder by default under the root directory of the SDS resource node.


###

- <b>Delete an uploaded file</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    delete <filehash>
    ```

###

- <b>Share(public) an uploaded file</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    sharefile <filehash> <duration> <is_private>
    ```

> `duration` is time period(in seconds) when the file share expires. Put `0` for unlimited time.
>
> `is_private` is whether the file share should be protected by a password. Put `0` for public file without password, and `1` for private file with a password.
>
> After this command has been executed successfully, SDS will provide a password to this shared file, like `m216`. Please keep this password for future use.

####

- <b>List All Shared Files</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    allshare
    ```
####

- <b>Download a shared file</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    getsharefile <sharelink> [password]
    ```
> Leave the `password` blank if it's a public shared file.
>
> `sharelink` could be found when your use `allshare` to list all available shared files.
>
> The downloaded files will be saved into the folder `download` by default under the root directory of your resource node.


###

- <b>Cancel file share</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    cancelshare <shareID> 
    ```
  > `shareID` could be found when your use `allshare` to list all available shared files

###

- <b>View resource utilization</b>

  ####

    ```shell
    # show the resource utilization monitor
    monitor
    
    # hide the resource utilization monitor
    stopmonitor
    ```
