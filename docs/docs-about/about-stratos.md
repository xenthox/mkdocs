## The Meaning of ‘Stratos’

The name Stratos comes from the word ‘stratosphere’. The stratosphere is an important layer of the earth’s atmosphere. The bottom of the stratosphere is 10 km above the ground, 8 km at the poles, and its upper boundary is about 50 km above the ground. The air in the stratosphere mainly flows in the horizontal direction, while the flow of air in the vertical direction is weak, so the layers of air are stable and there is almost no vertical convection.

Stratos is the infrastructure for decentralized services. If I can compare the earth to the blockchain ecosystem, then Stratos is the stratosphere surrounding the blockchain environment, providing blockchain applications with decentralized storage, decentralized databases, and decentralized computing services.

## The Significance of Decentralization

Compared with centralization, the two most important differences of decentralization are Equal Rights and Data Ownership. Let me explain what I mean by that. In a decentralized system, all participants have equal rights, and all data belongs to the data creator, not to the owner of the system. For example, although the customer services, information search, online storage, and email services of the centralized system provided by Google are free, the real cost is your personal data. Google will use your personal data to gain commercial benefits.

The blockchain is decentralized by providing equal rights and data ownership. Each node participating in the blockchain has equal rights, although some nodes with stronger computing power or nodes participating in staking have a greater chance of generating the block. The ledger data of the blockchain is public, but unlike a centralized network, the verification right for the key data only belongs to the owner of the private key which cannot be taken by anyone.

This can be approached from another perspective as well, by asking the question: Is decentralization the same as blockchain? Here I would like to describe the two terms in a more technical manner. Blockchain is a network where multiple nodes participate asynchronously through a consensus mechanism. The data on multiple nodes is forced to be synchronized within a fixed time interval and reach consensus. Blockchain is a successful use case of a decentralized system and implementation, but it is definitely not the only solution. Some decentralized projects add blockchain into their system design for different business needs which don’t require blockchain, and thus these projects set themselves up to fail.

> “Stratos decentralized infrastructure will greatly shorten the arrival time of the new Era of Decentralization. Stratos’s objective is to be like Bitcoin in 2010 which created a blockchain empire, or like Ethereum smart contracts in 2015 which enriched the prosperity of the blockchain system. Stratos will become the most solid cornerstone of the Era of Decentralization, supporting the decentralized service infrastructure, and contributing to the blockchain industry. Providing the decentralized system with air, water, and sunlight, we develop the entire ecosystem in the stratosphere, making it more stable, more prosperous, and more sustainable.”

The blockchain system design has been verified since Bitcoin appeared decades ago. The different implementations of different public chains have proven that the blockchain is an excellent system for providing public ledgers and smart contract services on top of the ledgers. But besides that, the design of blockchain is not suitable for all projects that aim to provide decentralized services.

Therefore, blockchain is only one of the application subsets of decentralization. As the provider of the infrastructure for decentralized services, Stratos uses different decentralized components rather than only using the blockchain. Stratos is the infrastructure of the blockchain industry, and provides the full spectrum of services for the entire blockchain industry, rather than just attaching to a public chain, let alone being solely an add-on product of a public chain ecosystem.

Since the birth of the blockchain industry in 2010, the sector has been looking for a breakthrough in serving traditional industries. But since blockchain can only provide public ledger services, it hasn’t been making a lot of progress for the industries that don’t need ledger based services. At the same time, due to the unprecedented development of the token economy in the blockchain industry, most of the projects are mainly built around tokens. This has led to even more misconceptions for people outside the blockchain industry. Many people outside the blockchain industry believe that the blockchain and decentralized systems have no practical value due to lack of widely used applications in traditional industries. The real situation is that decentralized systems cannot be used in traditional industries not because the traditional industries do not need decentralized services, but that current decentralized services fail to meet the needs of traditional industries.

The infrastructure of Stratos decentralized services, whether from design or development, is not only for the blockchain industry but also for better serving centralized traditional industries. Stratos will eventually commercialize the provision of decentralized services, providing decentralized systems with more efficient, secure, and stable infrastructure and services for centralized traditional businesses.

## Stratos Past And Present

The Stratos team is a group of top-notch developers. The team members come from Canadian National Railways, Amazon, Expedia, Alibaba, and many other well-known companies. Everyone has world-class enterprise-level development experience.

One-third of the team members are from Mindgeek, a top 10 Internet company with the largest traffic volumes. During the 7 years of working at Mindgeek, as the founder of the Cloud team, I designed and developed the data platform from scratch to process millions of records of data per second and hundreds of billions of records per day. The data platform provides various data services for more than 100 million users worldwide every day. This valuable design and development experience of creating a global data network represents Stratos’s history, allowing Stratos to have the genes to achieve large-scale commercial applications from the very beginning of its creation.

Thanks to the great amount of practical experience and the basis of Google GFS and Hadoop HDFS architecture, the team expands the distributed storage to decentralized storage solutions. Stratos decentralized storage is born with the high-performance storage module.


## Stratos is composed of 4 modules and 3 layers.

This can sound a bit technical, but bear with me. The 4 modules Stratos services are composed of include blockchain, decentralized storage, decentralized databases, and decentralized computing. Just as the earth needs air, water, soil, and sunlight, each of these four elements is indispensable to the provision of the necessary conditions for the growth of everything. Different combinations of these four modules will also provide various decentralized services for the blockchain industry and traditional industries.

The three layers are the value layer, the resource layer, and the meta service layer. Each layer corresponds to a different consensus mechanism. The value layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, the resource layer uses Proof-of-Traffic (PoT) consensus, and the meta service layer uses Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus.

The design of three layers and three consensuses smartly solves the impossible triangle problem of decentralization to the greatest extent possible.

1. PoA is the closest consensus algorithm to centralization, ensuring that the meta service layer remains efficient when decentralized

2. PoS is to make sure the value layer is secure and robust

3. PoT is a completely decentralized consensus algorithm, which ensures that the resource layer can expand indefinitely, allowing more resources to join the Stratos network

The three layers are also three types of nodes. Miners can choose to join the Stratos network based on their varying hardware specifications and requirements.

The four modules of Stratos are composed of three layers, combining different consensus mechanisms to form Stratos’s internal solid triangle, which can provide customers with stable, reliable, and efficient decentralized services.
